		    <blockquote>
			    <p class="white-text">Lumens are the native asset of the Stellar network.</p>
				<p class="white-text">Native means that lumens are built into the network. Asset is how the network refers to an item of value that is stored on the ledger.</p>

				<p class="white-text">One lumen is a unit of digital currency, like a bitcoin.<br/>

					While you can’t hold a lumen in your hand, they are essential to the Stellar network—they contribute to the ability to move money around the world and to conduct<br/> transactions between different currencies quickly and securely.

			    	First, you need a wallet for this. Guess what? That's exactly what XLMwallet is!<br/>
			    	Then, you have to generate a key pair (a public and a private key), these are used to access to your wallet.
			    </p>
			    <p class="white-text">The public key starts with a <b>G</b> while the secret key starts with a <b>S</b></p>
			    <p class="lighter-purple-text text-lighten-3">
			    	You must absolutely keep secret your private key (which is actually called secret key), if someone else has access to it, he has access to your funds!

			    	To receive Lumens, you have to give your <u>public key</u> to the sender.
